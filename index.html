<h1>Table Top RPG Kit!</h1>
<p>
    Largely, this is a me thing. Just a few various tools that are either open source from others or small tools I've
    written in order to help me stay creative or to give me some sort of help/inspiration when I'm stuck on a
    campaign or writing idea. Whether or not I decide to beautify or streamline this in anyway is yet to be
    determined. For now, it is what it is.
    This website is a curration of variouse opensource tools to help you build your world. Geared, largely, toward Game
    Masters (GMs) but these tools are also great if you're working
    on building worlds for your literary works, movies, tv shows or for any other purpose.
