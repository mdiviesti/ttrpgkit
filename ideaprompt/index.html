    This is just a random icon generator. It uses FontAwesome icons and randomly pulls 10 of the icons within their
    "free" tier. The idea from this came from the video <a href="https://youtu.be/9GBPTec5TZA?t=1738">Easy Ways to be
    your own GM (solo RPGing)</a> where Youtube user "Geek Gamers"
    suggested using a set of dice with pictures on them to help suggest ideas. I figured, we could do some fun stuff
    like this but using a source that had more icons than what is limited to dice. Refreshing the browser will
    randomly generate more icons.

<p>If your world is low tech but you keep getting icons for modern items, think about what the low tech version of
    those would be. A motorcycle could easily be a horse instead.</p>
