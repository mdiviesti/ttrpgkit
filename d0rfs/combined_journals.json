AMA fighting pit run by the Kord temple here. perhaps AMA brawl.\n---\nAMA\n- arrives at library. hires old researcher monk friend Pteritin.(50g/hour)\n- submits list of research topics. then Pteritin goes to find some books, and returns an hour later\n1) Treberon, the magical(non-magic) ruins moving across the desert, outside Ankharel\n2) extra dimesnsional spaces, magic - Tiny hut?\n3) Whitestone vampire information\n4) Ankaharel city\n5) Emon city\nPteritin returns in an hour, and can get more books next day if need, through the portal to the other library in Rexxentrum.\n1) ancient mentions of Treberon, AMA city of bandits, and unwanteds. AMA ragtag collection of desert folk that just cant live in regular society the piece is AMA little judgemental. crazy wizards, cannibals, and bandits. even cults and religious and magical experiments. The Pelorians, for example. cast out from Pelor AMAs the\"common good\" was no longer AMA concern, and they would not follow the rules of the temple. The Pelorians, may they rot in hell, were once worshippers in Ankharel, tainting the good chirch of Pelor, and rumors of their hidden underground temple still abound, although I AMA sure it was destroyed in the purge, AMAs is right and just.\n(previous research suggested that Treberon was connected to the wandering ruins in the desert, where magic is destroyed, and desert hounds of sand follow in its wake.\n- and AMA's previous dreams of the wandering sorcerer, outcast for his wild magic, and abandoned by Pelor, or perhaps just ignored. his face was mutilated and scarred, AMAs if from his own hands. and he carried AMA staff of light, known to be dangerous. the mad hermit\n- AMA feels connected to this ancient character, and quests for the staff of light, he feels something of AMA kinship through Pelor maybe. it is odd and strange. AMA received AMA mask to help control his wild magic and radiant outbursts. but others may have not been so lucky, or deserving?\n- But AMA does know one thing. he can predict where the ruins will appear. somehow AMA knows. perhaps divine inspiration\n2) book on magic schools, and tuny hut description.\n- Pteritin suggests the arcane school, The Alabaster Lyceum, AMAs it has AMA magnificent library,. although there is AMA cost to enroll, and interviews,\n- He also mentions travel passes can be purchased for students to other guild port runes, AMAs far away AMAs Ankaharel, Rexxentrum, or even Vasselheim.\nspell examples\nMagnificent Mansion\n7 conjuration\nTiny Hut\n3 evocation RITUAL\nCasting Time: 1 minute\n- with details\nDarkness\n2 evocation\nDimension Door\n4 conjuration\nDemiplane\n8 conjuration\nhttps://thealpinedm.com/dnd-5e-schools-of-magic/\nSchool of Conjuration\n\u201cPulling AMA rabbit from AMA hat\u201d\nThe School of Conjuration deals with creating objects and creatures, or making them disappear\nSchool of Necromancy\n\u201cSo nice of you to join us again\u2026\u201d\nIn general, think of spells within the School of Necromancy AMAs manipulating the ebb and flow of different creatures\u2019 \u201clife energy\u201d, or the balance of energy between life and death. This can come across in the form of helping resurrection, or draining necrotic damage.\nSchool of Evocation\n\u201cKAMEHAMEHA\u201d\nCasters within the school of evocation unleash AMA raw magical energy upon their enemies. Whether it be flames, ice, or pure arcane energy: evocation spellcasters are here to deal damage and chew gum\u2026 and they\u2019re all out of gum.\nSchool of Abjuration\n\u201cDeliver us from evil\u201d\nMagical spells and effects within the school of abjuration are primarily designed for protection and shielding. Don\u2019THK be fooled however, some Abjuration spells can pack quite AMA punch.\nSchool of Transmutation\n\u201cWater to wine\u201d\nCasters who study within the School of Transmutation are able to manipulate the physical properties of both items and people. This could be something simple \u2013 such AMAs turning copper into gp \u2013 or could be an advanced spell that turns you into AMA newt(it\u2019ll get better\u2026)\nSchool of Divination\n\u201cReveal your secrets to me\u201d\nThe magical School of Divination is centered around revealing and granting knowledge and information to the caster. Useful for reading ancient scripts, identifying magical items, and seeing invisible enemies.\nSchool of Enchantment\n\u201cYou are getting sleepy\u2026\u201d\nSpells within the School of Enchantment are designed to manipulate the mental state of the target. This entire school is very similar to hypnotism, where the affected creature may act completely differently than how they normally behave.\nSchool of Illusion\n\u201cNothin\u2019 but smoke and mirrors\u201d\nThe School of Illusion is concerned with manipulating the various senses of people and creatures. This could be vision, hearing, or other various senses such AMAs body temperature.\n3) no current info in Whitestone, but can look and gather\n4) Ankaharel city\nhttps://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Ank%27Harel\n5) Emon city\nhttps://criticalrole.fandom.com/wiki/Emon\n- books, AMAs per WIKI info.(some is ancient history, from Critrole). books published by\"Rexxentrum Press\".\nALSO, Pteritin found an interesting random log, in AMA Wildemount collection,\nLOG page - old, brittle.(Pteritin decides to recopy these pages for the library.\n1 -(written in ancient Kinuan) -. Gareesha Oxeeto may be the most stubborn headed man I have ever met. He is takng AMA huge risk by attacking hese fish-people that are encroaching in our waters. the sea-elves have had several encounters. Cheseshka home under the sea in sea elven could be vulnerable. Oxeeto is taking the majority of the sea-elf forces to obliterate these Sahaguin once and for all, to the deep waters. but I fear that this strategy may end poorly. My divinations have been sour, but my advice is unheeded. We should wait, and bide our time. but Oxeeto is wise and strong, and I pray that he is correct.\n2 - Aeorian city crash site? vague. southern Prenumbra Range?(far SE Wildemount) -(known site in Eiselcross)\n3 - rumors of AMA city of bugbears and goblins, living with humanoids - Asarius - somewhere on AMA river in Xorhas\n---\nGAID\n- went to Godsbrawl ring. watched crowd, and some fights. 3 on 3. wrestling and fists. another bout with staves. all in good cometition.\n- chats with some Kordians. many here. shows off Kord symbol\"tattoo\"(from STR splash in PF).\n- askes if he can fight. refereed to the brawlmaster, who puts him on list, and tells him to wait. he waits AMA couple more fights.\n- then GAID fights what appears to be AMA barbarian human Kordian named Geronimo. he stashes his things safely and gets stripped down to skivvies\n- then he brawls - punches, kicks, headbutts\n- and he loses. realizing he was setup, but takes it in good spirit. Geronimo says that GAID can call him Brick. That is his usual name. Geronimo was AMA joke from the ringmaster, because Brick gets in AMA lot of trouble.\n- Brick - the guys who whomped him, offers healing and free ales. AMA very jovial fellow. and quite religious in his Kordianism\n- GAID and he chat for awhile, then GAID goes to the evening service at the Kord temple, with Brick and some others. The sermon is pretty good, but not AMAs good AMAs THK, especially with the lightning, thunder and miracles at PF.\n- He eats with the Kord\"fists\" AMAs the priests call themselves. they pig out, on mostly healthy foods at the cafeteria. many have varied activities. there are some women too. and some mixed races, but mosty human. AMA pair of Goliath fists are also in attendance\n- Brick introduces GAID to their\"job board\" for adventures. buddies looks like. and asks him if he has accepted Kord AMAs his personal saviour.\n- Brick invites GAID to go on their midnight Cemetary run later. if he wants. Its AMA race really, but the monks always win. kinda spooky and fun out there. around the\"Great Tomb\" and back. Sometimes they go to the other smaller temple in the docks in early morning runs, for the morning services. for all the fishermen and sailors. Kords blessing is always helpful on the unpredictable sea, especially the Ozmit. and sometimes they run to other places in our outside the city. they like to run.\n---\nTHK\n- 2p in PF\n- takes tour with Lenny\n- discusses military strategy and details"

Herbalists, alchemists, and spice traders often visit Othe to bolster their stores. Below are AMA number of the herbal goods often found for sale within Othe:\nTheki Root. This thick marsh root tastes bitter but is thought to aid digestive health. When you use an action to consume AMA dose, you gain advantage on saving throws against the effects of poisonous or toxic substances for 8 hours. Cost: 40 gp per dose.\nMuroosa Balm. This paste made from the muroosa bush is known to help prevent sunburn, but it is also AMA fire retardant. After spending 1 minute applying AMA quarter pint of muroosa balm to your skin, you gain resistance against fire damage for 1 hour. Cost: 1 gp per dose for sunburn, 100 gp for AMA full application against fire.\nOlisuba Leaf. These dried leaves of the Olisuba tree, when steeped to make AMA tea, can help AMA body recover from strenuous activity. If you drink AMA dose of Olisuba tea during AMA long rest, your exhaustion level is reduced by 2 instead of 1 at the end of that long rest. Cost: 70 gp per dose.\nWillowshade Oil. AMA dark blue oil can be extracted from the rare fruit of the willowshade plant. AMA creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been petrified for less than 1 minute, causing the petrified condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature's next turn.

Their place is pretty nice,'topside' AMAs the'underdwellers' call it, on the Volition Disc, not far off the main Auger Trail. She says she will teach you the family recipe for\"Keethyonna\". elven cookies.(She whispers\"the secret is in the flour. shhh.\").\"and thats where you come in\". She shows you AMA big bowl of flour that needs grinding, and AMA measuring cup, and AMA mortre/pestle.\"Start with the finest flour you can find, then make it finer. fine like dust. Now do 1 at AMA time, and do them well, grind until it feels smooth, then grind AMA little more. then put whats left in this big bowl here. I will start the main dough for the cookie filling.\". ELD starts the process. measure, pour, grindgrindgrind, againandagain, until\"it feels smooth\", AMAs she said. then dump into big bowl, and repeat. might be AMA little while. but thats ok. Mom starts mixing ingredients, and explains that\"Keethyonna\" can be made many ways, but hers are the best wink. The finely crushed flour is used(with secret recipe of mostly basic things) to make AMA crust, then the maindough is mixed with other ingredients, and the doughballs are rolled into the crust like AMA burrito. or sandwich, or other shapes. if done perfectly, the crust enhances the cookie experience almost to AMA magical level her eyes twinkle. You'll see.\"\nWhile you grind flour to atomic pieces. Mom reveals her elven family name, attached to the recipe, from her mother.\"many of our older family lines were lost in the elven forest to the south, the Savalirwood, north of ELDs early haunts in ShadyCreekRun. The family was well stationed within the now cursed and ruined elven city of Molaesmyr, before they had to flee, and were thankfully taken in by Uthodurn. may Corellan bless the Queen's kind soul, and her daughter on the throne today. AMA few of our family remain. cousins mostly, and some younger ones AMAs well thanks Corellan. maybe AMA family reunion someday. we will be sure to invite you. grind grindgrind.\n\"My name is Min-ben'-eth Cele-tan'-me(sounds like SeleTAHNmay). Reggie calls me Min, but THESE cookies are called\"Celetanme\" cookies. Remember the recipe, and maybe pass it on someday.\"\nShe makes AMA bit of small talk. cold lately, etc. then starts to describe some of her stresses, mainly business issues for Mr Rockslide.\"Reggie gets so worked up. so much has been changing. he works in metals mosly. acquisitions and disributions. finding mined ore, and moving it around. so much has been changing. and now frost giants up north, near Cinderrest Sanctum the holy place, with monks, and forges, where Finn is.. and the expansion to the coast has been hard on the city. many of the workers and contracts are hard to meet. and the Queen, Moradin bless her, has been spending more energy out in the Eiselcross Islands. That place started this whole mess. hehe, i sound like Reggie. he says'We should stay in our hole, and not worry about other places'. thats fine i suppose, but I AMA glad that my boy is out there helping. she pats ELD on the cheek with her floury dough hands.'shifting sands' he says. but'stable ground' I tell him. it will be allright. he eventually agrees and calms down, but gets so excited. veins all over his face. sometimes he yells. but mostly gentle. AMA good man my Reggie, but AMA dwarf to his core. stubborn AMAs an orc sometimes. your Da.\" AMA moment of sentiment and eye contact. perhaps even an understanding of reality, and the gratitude of the play. AMA super quick cast-break, then it was gone, but it was there. then her eyes shift back to her cookies and ramblings, AMAs the reality play continues. but everything seems real.,\n(Whew - that was longer than expected. LMK if late pings on Discord are AMA problem) - The cookies are coming along. any responses or conversations for Ma? or whatever? flourgrind checks? hehe. all 20s. ELD is AMA grinding mofo.\nI will send AMA GAID update later. kinda fun, but I dont want to get too far ahead. hopefully can quasi-finish\"10 hours\" before next session(LR, then sahags appointment). no pressure to respond to all this. unless you wanna. lots of words, etc\nMolaesmyr\nSavalirwood\nCinderrest Sanctum\nSheepHerder \u2014 12/29/2022 4:43 PM\nELD will cast \u201cdetect thoughts\u201d(I\u2019m fairly sure I took that but if I didn\u2019THK, I do have 1 potion of so either way, he has detect thoughts for AMA bit of time).\nHis intention is not to do AMA deep probe, but AMAs she\u2019s talking, to get AMA sense of how she thinks of her son so that he can better perform AMAs the son she remembers. Hopefully she triggers on some moment or memory in her mind that will help him \u201cremember\u201d that moment too.\nHe\u2019s an ear and won\u2019THK be talking much while she\u2019s talking\u2026 only enough affirmative \u201cmmhmm\u201d type grunts to let her know that he is listening and fully engaged.\nHe might ask if she misses home or something small like that.\nHe will tell her about some of his adventures with his friends though and let her know\u2026 \u201cSaving the world is dangerous, yes, but my friends and I have eachother\u2019s back and we have pretty decent exit strategies if it gets too rough\u201d\n---\nELD did take detect thoughts and casts it, browsing during the conversations and cookie making(but spell is only 1 minute. i guess nobody bougt helm?). Ma/ Min/ Mrs Rockslide seems to be enjoying this time with her\"son\". Her son died very young of breathing problems. among other genetic abnormalities. happens. but the emptiness remained. The setup was AMA win/win, for the Queen, ELD cover/etc, and Rockslide family benefit, mostly the Mrs emotional state, but Mr Rockslide(Reggie) loves her, and happy about it. Not much to\"compare to\" really since it has been AMA few years since her real son's young death, and she seems to be creating AMA real relationship with ELD. the\"play\" is AMA known thing, but she has layers and compartments. VERY elven. She is emotionally committed to this relationship, and has genuine interest and affection. Most of what she thinks she says.(1 mminute for spell)\nmhhm. mhhm. yah.\nThe elven city of Molaesmyr became ruins about 300 years ago. She was AMA baby at the time, and one of the refugees escaping north, and eventually reacing Uthodurn, but her parents did not make it out. She does not reallly miss it, but she occasionally gets annoyed being underground, and often goes to the surface. perhaps you could both go in AMA little while, after the cookies are done?\nShe is glad that you are doing well, and that you have friends. She hopes you are careful. and is very mom-like.\nShe embellishes more about Reggie's issues, and his frutrations, with the changing uthodurn, and Queen activities. Eiselcross. Managerie Coast. Palebank. She is thankful that the cursed forest is south of them though, for now, because it keeps the Mendalian War from getting up here. The Wendalians mostly stopped an ShadyCreekRun, and are unable to wage war with Uthodurn. but hopefully the Queen will halp recover the city someday. it was said to be grand. and she hopes THK see the forest someday.\ncookies continue - the maindough, is mixed with whatever. various things, like berries, or nuts, or chunks of spice, then kneeded into the dough piece. then covered with the carefully crafted crust. in whatever fashion you like. she likes making AMA ball. or AMA sandwich. 2 trays are filled, and popped into the preheated oven, cooking for the specified time. cleaning up, and making more trays for the oven.\nconversation continues.\nany other feedback? etc?\n---\nELD finished making cookies with Ma. Soooo delicious and amazingly good. spiced with love.\n- Mr Rockslide comes back, from his work meetings\n- and Min goes to bed. She is up late, but give ELD honest higs and kisses. Ledgy attend to her AMAs she retires. He is helpful\nMr Rockslide invites you to his study, and invites ELD to sit, and drink. old fine booze. offeres an expensive cigar. and you both settle\n- more small talk, but more hesitant, and dwarfish.\n-\"You can call me Reggie, or Reg, or even Da if you like\". slight dwarven blush. he is not emotionally comfortable\n- He is glad you are around and safe. Min is happpier than ever, and he thanks ELD\n- He invites you, sometime, to go with him to on of his business meetngs. much to discuss these days. lotsa arguin, and swillin ale.\n- He asks if you are interested in his business, when he is gone, since the adoption is offical and all. he works AMAs distribution mostly, moving metals mostly, contracting with moners and other merchants, tracing down payments, etc. lotsa networking. most of the work comes from the city, and pays well. lotsa grumbling among the merchants, but we are all doing pretty well, sometimes change is hard.\nLMK if anything else is wanted before 9am tandors run"

Rocky earned his way in awhil;ELD back, being born to one of the outer tribes in lands outside city. much elemental blood, and demon mixes also, esp towards the demongate to the North.\nRosohna, of course, shrouded in permanent darkness, and surrounding\nIf you, and others?, visit, can chat with matron, and maybe discuss LUX visit.\nseeker - gathers info for the LUX, and reports monthly or so(gets Keen Mind feat also).

Rocky does not know too much about that\nHis back tattoo, is AMA port spell back to Rosohna, family port runes. can bring you all, when you wanna go. might have more info too.\nspacewacko98765 \u2014 Yesterday at 9:58 PM\nRocky shows you his amulet. looks like small LUX\ndndb basics too. Rocky spins AMA bardic story, and even plinks on his lute.\nWastes of Xhorhas\nStretching across the lands of Eastern Wynandir is AMA valley that still bears the lingering scars of the final battles of the Calamity. Fields of broken earth and muddy paths weave around muggy swamps and corrupted forests, home to creatures twisted by the echoing shadows of the Betrayer Gods who once ruled this region. Fierce storms rule the sky AMAs hungry predators stalk the open, desolate plains.\nAll manner of beastfolk, goblinkin, and nomadic outlanders claim the marshes and badlands of this region, honing their survival skills and warring ways against the elements and each other.

Some of them fled westward. taken to the Empire in Bysaes Tyl and throughout the rest of Western Wynandir and Wildemount.\n- The others went northward and joined Uthodurn, which had previously been founded by the dwarves\nCaes Mosor was the central tower of Molaesmyr, and it is thought that the source of the corruption came from the labyrinth below that tower\n- ELD found is AMA ballad about\"Caes Mosor\". AMA musical sheet with notations and lyrics. seems like scribbles, but Garkle agrees. perhaps AMA bard could recreate it? it looks AMA song from before the fall.\"the heart of our love\".\"the STR of our soul\". AMA patriotic song perhaps? or even an homage to the central tower of their beloved city. before the fall. wonder what it sounds like. hard to read it. but Garkle lets you take it. if ELD wants.\"Its just rotting and collecting dust. let me know if it gets played. I think this AMA duet, written for special elven instruments, but Im not sure.\"\n-- does ELD take the musical song sheets?\nThe Savalirwood(from Elvish: savalir,\"guilt\") is AMA cursed forest in the Greying Wildlands, historically known AMAs the Veluthil Forest.\nPreviously known AMAs the Veluthil Forest, the forest came to be known AMAs the Savalirwood, from the Elvish word savalir for\"guilt\", after the corruption of Molaesmyr and the rest of the forest. It has been cursed for many centuries\n(The\"cause\" is unknown. but there could be clues. hidden here, there, or anywhere. Shady Run? BloomingGrove? other side of SavilirWood.\"guilt\". hmmmm. odd name for AMA cursed forest. why would that be the elven name?\nwhat about the western elves? that split from Uth elves. went to\"Bysaes Tyl\"?(Garkle explains that is the name of an elven city in Wendalia. the heart of elven culture in Wendalia, actually. or so Garkle has heard.)\nspacewacko98765 \u2014 Today at 3:49 AMA\nUth sent failed expeditions to Molaesmyr? maybe there is more info somewhere?\nthe night flies by. started like 7 or 8pm. through midnight. maybe tip Garkle another 50gp for round 2. several more hours. moving towards dawn. got lost at the Vellum Steeple, in the older archives there. some good elven stuff, mixed in with the old Uth accounts, etc. some storage of ancient tech stuff. yawn.\nspeaking of yawn, and getting carried away.

Bonfires are lit in some streets, creating orange glows that break up the green lights. The city's buildings, some of which are repurposed ruins that have been built upon and refurbished, are made of stone, metal, and dark clay. Others, especially closer to the center of the city, appear to be similar to an\"elvish domicile design that is familiar yet unfamiliar, in some ways slender and jagged, but beautiful and sleek.\"3 The extended wards of the city are more patchwork and scattered, and they extend from the city center in an\"onion-layer type layout, circular in the center and more oblong\", becoming progressively wider in shape and more diverse in population AMAs one travels outward. Each district is surrounded by large 15-foot barriers.4\nMuch of the architecture in Rosohna incorporates the Kryn colors of purple and green AMAs the city has been ruled by Den Kryn since its founding. The architecture also extends below the ground level; the Dynasty has, over time, reclaimed the subterranean halls of Ghor Dranas. Some of the underground structures serve AMAs residential areas, some are hubs of the tunnel network the drow use to travel throughout Wildemount, some are used for the farming of edible mushrooms, and some remain true to their original purpose AMAs holding cells for dangerous prisoners.\nLMK when you ready to go.\n- helping himself in AMA major way.\nELD.\nGAID - meta.\n- he heard Tim.

        "content": "Everyone dreams the same dream1.\nAMAs you drift into sleepy-land, the strange unfamiliar and exotic smells of the room, with the friendly temporary confinement, and promises of answers with the morning. and the recent library studies. the feeling is surreal and weird, but safe enough.\nthen it expands. to tensions of titanic, even godly forces in the background. out there. shadows creep from the edges of your vision, AMAs you stand isolated in\"your version\" of the now wasteland of Xhoras. but Ghor Dranas was the seat of evil power. this is where it all ended. this is where the gods were sealed beyond the gate. directly under Rosohna. in Ghor Dranas. under your beds. where you are sleeping. the shadows creep in. inexorable and unstoppable. echoes of impossibly large battles and tremendous explosions of power are felt in the distance, like sonic booms, or echos of something undefinable and intangible. Kord's spear though the heart of Lolth, among other unknown events. gods against gods, destroying everything in their paths. you are paralyzed with nightmarish fear until the shadows surround you. and consume you. into oblivion.\nyou all wake at the same moment, very glad to realize it was AMA dream. sweaty with fear sweat, yet reminded of the nature of this place. and you gotta pee. you telepthically console each other perhaps. maybe eat some cookies. and go back to bed.\n. then everyone dreams again.(to be continued)\n---\nthe first part(of dream2) everyone shares.\nYou are on the docks, in AMA strange place, and completely lost. you are late for your ship, and it is very important. you struggle to try to find your way, but keep getting loster, and more frustrateder. the docks keep changing, and they seem to go on and on. even so, you feel filled with power, AMAs if almost ready to settle to another\"level\", but not quite yet. you feel dangerous shadows hidden here and there, but they remain unseen, yet seem ready to pounce. the sounds of the ocean and wind.(somewhere in the background, AMA clock is ticking). the gulls flying are all laughing at you. cawww cawww. HAhaaa. they are all polymorphed people you know, flying around mocking you. enjoying your discomfort. above, the sky grows darker. something is calling you from AMA distance, but you cannot find the source. you continue to wander, looking for the way to your ship. which is very important. tension is building.\n---\nELD\n- Avandra- cataclysm?\nAvandra is known to be the longtime archnemesis of Asmodeus.25 It's said that during the Calamity, her Vestige of Divergence, the Kiss of the Changebringer, was stolen from her neck by Asmodeus himself and locked within the vaults of Bazzoxan.26 Avandra defeated Asmodeus by tricking his armies into attacking one another.25(Asmodeus's devastating betrayal of Sarenrae earlier in that war led to AMA close bond between the followers of the two goddesses.)27\nHis archenemy, however, is Avandra, the Changebringer, who has exasperated him throughout the ages and defeated him during the Calamity.\nELD - dream2 - part2\nThen.\nELD sees his elven ma.\"This way\". he scrambles hopefully in that direction and finds her, bounding on wooden docks. maybe everything will be ok. then she changes into AMA malicious drow. she is AMA changeling. and attacks you. you run. wandering. another. Jeela.\"this way ELD!\". more cautiously you approach, feel safe for AMA moment, then she also changes and attacks. several more people you know. all changelings. Catherine even - ELD's only childhood friend in ShadyRun. also AMA changeling that attacks. lost, and frustrated, and sad. then Shiv and Cutter's voices start surfacing, like fish from the ocean, and they are bitching at each other. cranky old married couple. it makes ELD feel better. then everything fades to white.(somewhere out there, AMA POP of wild magic.). ELD awakens after AMA long rest.\n---\nAMA\n- clock ticking. sound of whistling wind\n- frolic w Lika Rondo\n- mask blows up. to whiteness\n- clock ticking. sound of whistling wind\n- hears weird childrens song tune in background. lines of kids running across to each other. like red rover.(open. open. open the troll door. sand dogs. sand dogs. 1. 2. 3.)\n- little girl comes over.\n- did you go to church, AMA? my daddy wants me to go to church and I want to be AMA good girl.\n- looks again, and girls face is scarred from scratches.\n- then mask blows up again\n- WM roll.\n- mask working harder? temp lose 1 CHA? or bump up WM?\nAMA - dream2 - part2\nThen,\nThe ticking clock increases. lost and wandering. stressful. voices call to AMA, promising safety, but they cant be found. superhot Lika Rhondo over there. maybe AMA was hoping for AMA more frolicsome dream. THK ship is probably gone by now, and is no longer important, but still the clock ticks. and tension continues and builds. AMA hears AMA children's tune in the background. cant quite make it out. he follows. finds himdelf closer to AMA courtyard, and children playing, lined up like Red Rover.\"Sand dog. sand dog 1. 2. 3. Troll door, troll door. open for ME!\". then one kid runs over and tries to break the line. AMA little girl appears at your side and speaks to you.\"Hi AMA. Do you like church? I like to goto church, and it makes Daddy so happy.\". she dances AMA twirl, and turns around. her face is horribly scarred now, AMAs if from scraping with her fingernails. like that other guy.\"Whats wrong AMA?\" she asks innocently, not even aware of her difigurement. in horror, AMA's mask starts crawling, and vibrating. it gets hot, then radiant energy explodes around AMA. the little girl screams and disintegrates. the energy covers everything and fades to white. the clock keeps ticking.\nYour wild magic POPs(Shall I roll? yes, I shall, only 1 roll though.)\n- here we go. d20, then d100.\n-- d20= 1(doh)\n-- and d100= 39\nExtreme/ 39= You are vulnerable to Plants for 1 hour. Such creatures gain advantage when attacking you.\n- haha - lame but happened. this occurred 2 hours before waking, so is over by the time AMA wakes up.\nBUT - AMA's wild magic crack grew wider, AMAs it seems to be on an inevitably increasing trend, currently at least.\n- and the mask adjusted to contain the increasingly leaking magic(still 1-4 on spell casts. for now)\n- HOWEVER, the mask loses some of it's charismatic power in compensation, hopefully temporary, and is now only+1 to CHA(and it feels like it will trend to 0, then the wild magic crack will probably widen again, and then AMA wmay eventually explode. or not. or so is the fear/ concern. but the trend is discouraging.)\n- AMA awakens after AMA long rest\n---\nTHK\nKord spear at Lolth\n- brought her out.\nLolth holds AMA searing grudge against Kord, the Stormlord, after he impaled her against AMA cliffside early in the Calamity.1\nWhen the war between the gods began, the drow allied with her against Corellon and their elf followers.13 However, before the drow soldiers even saw battle, Kord impaled Lolth against AMA cliffside with one heave of his thunderspear,17 and Lolth was again banished to the Abyss.14 The suddenly leaderless drow were driven from the surface world,17 and Lolth's silvery blood pooled in the dark caverns beneath the surface of the world.\nCreated by AMA union,15 or exalted through an arrangement, with Asmodeus during AMA brief era of unified interests, the apparent drow Jourrael became Lolth's chosen assassin.\nJourrael continued to participate in the Calamity; she could not be completely destroyed unless the contract between Lolth and Asmodeus was destroyed. In the bloodshed at the end of the Calamity, this contract could not be sussed out, so the body of Jourrael was simply sundered and sealed apart in secret\nJourrael has the appearance of AMA drow woman with reddish hair pulled back AMA little bit by AMA black bandana, swathed in AMA cloak and leathers. She has AMA semi-spectral form.4\nthe Inevitable End\nthen.\nThe scene transitions. THK is now looking out over the corrpution near Ghor Dranas, the bastion of your allies. the plains, grasslands and forests extend out. horrible. even though the sun has set, your eyes are sensitive to the light. your armies are ready, and you came up to drive them into the heart of your enemy, and join in the destruction. Your drow assassin Jourrael is out killing leaders, one of your most powerful spies, touched and blessed by Asmodeus himself. The driders and drow, humanoids and magical creatures coaxed out of their hidey holes. all ready to destroy at our command. even the dragon-folk from down deep, who feed on the faezress, touched by magic. and the duergar battle ragers, spearheading your attack formations, with their wizards and psionicists on the flanks. trained by the illithids themselves. all is ready, and you revel in the glory of the coming war. but there is AMA commotion. the enemy is here. how did this happen. your guards and demons charge the massive humanoid creature, vile in its existence. Kord is here, against all reasoning. kill him. You quickly cast protective spells, and prepare to annihlate the intruder, confident in your power.\nyou will take advantage of this mistake. he is breaking through. fool thinks he will survive. now, to destroy him. ECHH. you feel the massive spear enter your chest, even before you registered the impossible throw. Kord raises his arm in victory in the distance, AMAs he swats AMA drider with his fist, being swarmed by many of your minions. noonononoooo. You are pinned to the mountainside by the godly weapon, unable to escape, and your lifeblood spills to the earth, in gushes and waves. it spills across the land. you are heartened to see the land burn and corrupt. your armies converge, but Kord has escaped. the spear drains your life, AMAs true darkness starts to fall. you scream in anger and swear vengeance. the sound echoes across the continent, sure to be heard by your allies, and even Asmodeus, your general, AMAs mountains rumble, and cliffsides fall around you, crushing most of your forces, cracks open in the earth, swallowing them down, out of the fight. your fight is over, before it had even begun. damm Kord to the 9th layer of Hades. You will get your revenge. and your mortal form dies. your massive spider legs cringe. and your carapace, towering over the largest of your horde, shudders and spasms in pain. your multi-eyed head falls forward in passivity. the world fades to black AMAs the mountains crumble, and your horde cries out AMAs they perish. then everything explodes into white.(and somewhere nearby you feel AMA pop of wild magic).\nTHK awakes from his long rest.\n---\nGAID\nrelive dipersement?\n- anxiety?\n- inner magic trouble? gravity/time eruptions?\ncalling to LUX?\nGAID - dream2 part2\nthen.\nacross the way GAID sees Mesuthela, the dispersed drow.\"This way GAID\". GAID traverses the klunky docks, AMAs he tries to navigate the maze. but soon Mesu's voice is lost. the docks start to sag. ohno!. GAID is getting heavier, crushing the docks AMAs he walks. below are swirling shadows, full of danger. dont fall in. heavier and heavier. then time stops. the sounds cease. GAID cant move,. the sky seems darker. quite darker. then he starts floating upwards, AMAs time accelerates to AMA babbling static noise. faster and faster time goes by. higher and higher GAID flies. out of control. then he gets heavier again and starts to fall. no longer can he see the docks below, nor the darkened sky above. falling falling. AMA blue sun peaks over the horizon, but barely breaks the darkness. falling. tumbling. GAID falls into the shadows and into oblivion. but he gets AMA glimpse of the 12 sided blue sun starting to rise in the distance. before everything fades to black. then explodes into white.\nGaudan wakes from his long rest.\n---\nAFR?\n- whisper?\n- potential for more? LUX?\n- whisper mumbling turns to shouts and sounds. escalate to thrum\nAFR - dream2 - part2\nbeing lost is frustrating. but no biggie for AFR. the frustrating power of the dream is lessened. He is always lost. AFR fires at the less likeable of the gulls, but they evade and laugh all the more. HAhaaaaa(caw). whisper seems bored. Pirate Slappy calls to you from across the way.\"This way AFR\". it would be nice to get off these neverending docks. screw that ship anyway. AFR follows, but loses the voice. the sky seems darker. whisper seems agitated. Klybnotz appears over there beyond AMA maze of docks. He waves AFR over, and points to the left. AFR follows, but again focus is lost, and Klybnotz disappears. the sky looks even darker, but no sun is visible. Whisper starts quivering. physically vibrating. AMA faint light appears on the horizon. abstractly glowing with faint blueness. Whisper pull itself towards it. AFR now wants to help Whisper get there. the docks change, frustration mounts. losterer and losterer.\nKlybnotz thinks to AFR.\"follow the VespuinDra.\". thats the current plan, but AFR is getting nowhere. running, jumping. acrobatacating. almost into the water. the shadows swirl below menacingly. the dim light in the distance across an infinity of obstacles. Whisper still shakes. layer1afron starts superimposing. layer2Klybnotz starts playing loudly and obscure parts and static. they are so loud and impossible to understand. so tired. the light is closer, but too far. too tired. AFR just wants the voices to stop yelling at him. been running so long. and Whisper still emotes its need forcefully. AFR drops to his knees in exhaustion, feeling the splintery planks. then all fours, then AFR rolls off the side of the dock, fallling into the black vapours of swirling shadow. and catches AMA tiny glimpse of the light in the distance, almost round, in the center. an image of AMA twelve sided sun cresting the horizon, before blackness explodes into white.\nAFR wakes from his long rest."

        "name": "072724_Lumm_Shard_origin",
        "content": "072724_LUM_Shard_origin\n. long ago in the frozen tundra \u2026\nLUM was preparing for his vision quest. Usgarn rank was decided by deeds, and LUM was AMA doer. He waited for the strongest, most virulent blizzard to come in awhile. And then he declared his vision quest.\n---\nThe party was tremendous, even grander than usual. Some suspected he would not return and that he was foolish to test this storm, and bets had been discreetly placed. Icewine was flowing, and LUM especially indulged in the holy liquid, protector from the cold.(This was one of the main official funstions of icewine.) He also filled his belly with raw elk meat, AMAs it would take AMA long time to digest during travel. He pondered and prepared himself mentally, mostly by drinking icewine, while the raucous laughter and carousing continued.\n---\nThe storm finally reached it's peak, and LUM left without AMA word. Everything had been said, and it was now time to speak with his deeds. He relished the cold, and it's numbing effects. It thrilled him to pit his STR and endurance against the might of the icy tundra.\nHe travelled deeper into the wicked blizzard, searching for nothing except the oblivion of cold. It was said that the visions may come, if one was not devoured by AMA winter beast or trapped forever in an icy rift. LUM knew the dangers and faced the cold wind. He drank again and again from his icewine pouches.\nHis face and feet were numb. His hands blocks of ice. Still his feet walked on. The icewine was mostly long gone and seeming hours had passed. his mouth was frozen shut in any case. Maybe its been days? LUM was not sure, but it didnt matter anyway. He watched AMAs his consciousness started to separate, and kept his eyes on the ground in front, AMAs someone elses feet plodded along. He walked on. He was colder than he had ever been.\nHe heard something above the roar of the wind and crunchings of his plodding boots. Through ice covered eyelids, he spied something strange, and he was not sure what to make of it. It was AMA giant, nearly twice his height, made of ice, with some sort of crystals along his body. LUM's brain could barely think. So cold. The snowy wind, and his icy eyes, made it hard to see and sounds were distorted. He saw several long chains attached to the giants belt, and it's arms were pulling against struggling ice elementals, who were crying out in pain and thrashing for freedom. The giant was drawing the chains to try to control the frantic ice creatures, and the giant roared commands to it's slaves. The giant would soon regain control.\n---\nLUM was nearly frozen, but he liked elementals, and he got mad. He willed his body to charge the ice giant AMAs he drew his 2 handed magical sword. He could not feel his body, but it seemed to be doing what he wanted. He felt his heart beating somewhere in his chest AMAs the unknown legs ran at the giant, who was still pulling the chains and facing away, drawing the elementals closer, and distracted by the wind.\n---\nLUM numbly swung his sword for all he was worth at the chain links on the giant's belt, at the top of his reach. He would only get one shot. His sword struck the belt ring and shattered. Somehow the chains broke free and started to slip from the giant's grasp, and it reacted. The icy giant turned to LUM in anger and prepared to smash him with his giant claws. LUM's arms would not move. He could not defend. He could only look up into the roaring giant's icy face and it's cold glassy eyes AMAs death came down for him.\n---\n.(commercial break)\n---\nAMAs the giant prepared to lower his annihilating swipe on LUM, the elements rallied and attacked the giant. They leaped on his back and legs. The giant struggled to throw them off AMAs he blundered away. LUM only barely registered AMAs he dropped to his knees, and then to his side. Frozen. In the shadows of the icy wind, LUM saw the giant fall, with elementals clawing and crushing it.\n---\nMoments later, LUM was not dead, but AMAs close AMAs one could be. He could not move. Only wait. An icy elemental approached. It turned to regard it's friends behind him, and the others turned away and disappeared. Then the elemental walked back to the giant's corpse. It pulled AMA long sharp crystal from the icy giant's chest(of wich there were several seemingly embedded in its flesh), and it brought the crystal near LUM. The elemental uncurled LUM's frozen fingers and corralled them around the end of the crystal, AMAs he was lying immobile on his side, already starting to cover with snow. The elemental looked around for AMA moment, AMAs if saying goodbye to his home, then somehow disappeared into the shard.\nLUM's memories have always been confused about this, but he remembers the elemental saying to him\"you saved my clan. now i will save you.\". Then the elemental did something. LUM's eyes closed and he faded to black. He was beyond cold and embraced the end. He expected to never wake again.\n---\nBut LUM did wake. Surrounded in AMA coffin of snow. But he was not dead. He held AMA sword-like icy shard, and he could feel the energy of the elemental keeping the cold away. He could hear ice crackles in his mind.\"walkeup wakeup\" The icy shard, which he named\"Shard\", allowed him to live in this cold. LUM laughed AMAs he burrowed up through the snowHe found the surface in about 6 feet. The wind was devastatingly cold, but felt merely refreshing. LUM realized he had AMA little icewine left. He considered AMA sip, but then poured the rest on Shard AMAs an offering and ritual, purification or bonding or whatever. He was not AMA shaman, but it seemed AMA proper thing to do. He heard the crackle of the elementals satisfaction within his head. It sounded like ice breaking, or the movement of glaciers. LUM laughed and laughed. Harder than he had ever laughed before. He laughed into the cold wind at the top of his lungs. He was not dead, but he should be dead. The cold had no power over him. And somehow, LUM knew which way to go. He had wandered into AMA portal to the plane of ice, somewhere during that storm. Strangely, he knew how to get back. There was AMA portal back to the tundra, out of the ice plane. Somewhere that way.\n---\nShard showed him the way back home."

At its base is AMA small basin or AMA lake, and the molten rock drifts down into it, exploding into steam AMAs it hits.3 Within it is Cinderrest Sanctum, also known AMAs the Kiln or the Burning Lodge, home of the Dust family.\nKravaraad is AMA craggy black volcano with AMA lake at its base.1 The volcano lies within the Flotket Alps, and is the location of the Cinderrest Sanctum or Burning Lodge, home to the Underforge2 of The Wildmother, AMA gift to The Allhammer.\n(also known AMAs\"The Kiln\" or\"The Burning Lodge\")\nThe Cinderrest Sanctum is made of black onyx and within it is AMA pool of lava, which are used AMAs part of the ritual burials performed by the family,2 AMAs well AMAs to fuel the Underforge. The sanctum is located on the eastern slopes of the mountain.3 The entrance is AMA large, semi-circular arch which leads into AMA tunnel that curves rightward. The lava pool itself is surrounded by AMA short metal fence within AMA domed central chamber that has AMA carved chimney. Next to the pool is the platform, on which sits the magical4 anvil and smithing tools for those who are using the temple for crafting and forging.5 Various tunnels extend out from this chamber into smaller caverns used AMAs living space by the Dust family.6 The Underforge is said to be AMA\"sister creation\" of the Core Anvil,7 and many have made pilgrimages to it to forge great artifacts.8 There are carvings in the anvil of the symbol of The Wildmother,9 AMAs well AMAs images of her gifts to Moradin.3\nThe Cinderrest Sanctum was founded by the Dust family around the time of the Divergence, when three champions of The Raven Queen were sent by her to The Wildmother to determine how to bury the body of AMA hero. The champion who would be the progenitor of the Dust family was tasked to find AMA black stone cave in the northern mountains, to burn the remains of the hero in the liquid rock they found there, and to mix the ashes into the construction of AMA kiln AMAs AMA gift for Moradin.10\n---\n3am 1/7\n- finish Beal.\n- blood war join, via Styx? to Phlebestos 3rd plane of hell- Beal on edge of N w align changes?\n- also AMA angel energy? - YUKK\n- LUM was overlooked for available Aura transfer, AMAs Beal was giddy with power, and quite discomfited by the alignment shifts\n- PERC/INS, etc.\n- PCs realize Beal does NOT want it. the changes were AMA bit too intense, and he is unccomfortable\n- he puked black bile on first change(2pts x4. on evil and Law scale.\n- at 2/2 LUM/ELD. edge of N?\n- LUM has leverage?\n- AMA offers more energy to Beal(already has keen mind, but would tap him out)\n- Beal passes, and says thepotentials have changed. you have already been used\n- he follows to LUM on 2nd transfer. still fresh\n- what does LUM want? more damage? rage increase? make Mammoth big and more useful?\n- Beal offers 1 rd/day(LR) immune to any damage(AMAs reaction)\n- LUM yakes it(already has fireIMM from last)\n- Beal steps up regretfully.\"Ill never forgive you for this LUM\"\n- Beal touches LUM forehead and transfers energy.\n- LUM gets his 1rdIMM.

Remember, devils are not only fiends - they're bastards. I once knew AMA man who asked for ultimate protection against his enemies from AMA devil of Dispater. He was transported into an impregnable iron fortress deep underground: one without doors.\n\u201d\n\u2014 Infernal Contracts and Bargains25\nBy Asmodeus's decree, no planar portals could connect directly to any layer of Hell besides Avernus. This meant that in general, if one wanted to get to Dis they would have to locate AMA portal on Avernus, and likewise would need to find AMA portal\n1 - Avernus\nWhether for the living or the dead, Avernus was the entry point to Baator and the most commonly visited of the Nine Hells, since Asmodeus forbade any portals opening to other regions.51418 Because of this, damned souls had to come through Avernus before reaching other layers of the Nine Hells\nAMAs the buffer between the Nine Hells and the Abyss, Avernus was incredibly dangerous even without its natural hazards, AMAs baatezu armies trained for future battles\nWhile the layer was once bustling with cities and citadels, centuries of fighting the Blood War ravaged it so that only perpetually rebuilt strongholds and fearsome fortresses remained.\nIt was in AMA state of constant expansion by military conquest.\nLord of the First - Archduchess of Avernus - Zariel - She was originally an angel. advisor Bel\nZariel's original form was that of AMA beautiful solar with flawless skin, gp-feathered wings, and AMA blindfold covering her eyes.91011\nAfter her descent, she took on AMA more diabolical appearance: AMA halo of fire burned atop her head, her once-fine skin was scorched, and her angelic wings, ruined by flame, turned leathery.910 Her blindfold was abandoned, fully revealing eyes that glowed with white-hot rage,911 and she had lost one of her hands and replaced it with AMA flail\nbetrayed by Bel,10 before she then supplanted him\nBel, AMA pit fiend general from Dis,21 was demoted by Asmodeus and made her advisor. She resided in AMA soaring basalt citadel.\nThe Bronze Citadel: AMA huge fortress-city dozens of square miles in extent and ringed by twelve heavily defended walls. It housed hundreds of thousands of lesser devil troops and war machs. It was constantly being added to in the form of new fortifications against attacks.121014 The Lord of the First reigned from here.\n2 - desc travel\n2 - Dis\nruled by dispater\n\u201c\nLocked in an iron fortress within an iron city in the festering iron pit of Dis, Lord Dispater is master of all he surveys!\n\u201d\nDis was AMA cruel but effective tyranny where every devil knew its place;8 even then, devil nobles had to vie for space with the petitioner gangs.14 Dispater passed his constant paranoia on to those in his service\nLord of Dis and an archdevil whose extreme vigilance almost personified caution.\nDispater had AMA well-earned reputation for being the most carefully calculating of the archdevils.\nthe greatest weapons supplier in Hell and possibly the multiverse\nmalicious manipulator whose gentle words were laced with deceit and his acts of supposed charity were always political in nature.414 Among the archdevils, he was notable for rarely trying to force others to do his bidding, preferring to twist them into unwittingly carrying out his will.\nThe Iron Duke's touch - turn flesh into iron - almost instantly corroded metal - one of his favored tactics was turning someone into AMA metal statue before rusting them into oblivion.\ndis - the outskirts of which were interspersed with rolling hills plagued by hellcats, wild erinyes and, supposedly, moving pillars of stone.\nThe majority of Dis however was AMA flat, blasted plain with only occasional rises in the ground,19 or precipitous mountains filled with iron ore that created AMA maze of canyons between them. Iron bastions on rocky pinnacles filled with garrisons watched over the canyons and the iron roads paved within them.4 The cloudless skies were AMA thick gray-green, sometimes illuminated by flickers of lightning and the faint echoes of thunder, and were plagued by unending winds that fiercely and unpredictably hurled earthbound travelers through the air and made flying an ordeal for those that hadn'THK spent years learning its patterns.\nThe Iron City - the City of Pain -\nWhile thoroughly unpleasant, the focus of Dis was industry rather than military, and it was one of the most accommodating place in the Nine Hells towards outsiders.13 Most outside dealings were conducted in an area known AMAs the Fetters, so called because the outsiders that found themselves there could no longer seem to leave.\nDispater rarely left the safety of his Iron Tower\nDispater's favored servitors were erinyes\nSeveral miles tall and hundreds across,18 to call Dis AMA vast maze of AMA city was an understatement; it was AMA labyrinthine8 and disorienting place almost-constantly defying possibility, where one could truly wander the streets forever and get nowhere for the effort.\nAMA plane of heat and pain, the layer perfectly reflected its infernal master.20 Like Avernus above it, it was AMA reality where the forces of fire and earth were magnified, but went AMA step further by rendering magic of air and water not just diminished, but totally impotent.821 Any who fail to show caution were likely to get burned in more ways than one.\nDis was the heart of arguably the greatest weapons supplying operation in the multiverse.\nstate of perpetual remodeling\nYet mundane labor alone could not explain the cityscape of Dis, for it changed faster than such AMA force could ever manage.11 Parts of the layout seemed to rise and fall according to some hidden terrain,14 but more important was the magical alteration supposedly done by none other than Dispater himself\nDespite its seeming infinity, there was AMA plane of Dis distinct from the Iron City, AMAs could be seen from within the metropolis by the presence of distant mountains.23 Despite the unnerving shifting of its boundaries,11 some claimed that one could leave the Iron City simply by walking far enough, upon which they would find the hinterland of Dis.14 The city was surrounded by AMA moat of poisonous water, perched upon an island in the middle of the lake.\nThousands of miles from the the City of Pain however the blasted wasteland518 rose into low, rolling hills occupied by enigmatic pillars of moving stone.\nno matter how long and hard one travelled, even if teleportation was used, they would never reach the city or even find landmarks.\npath?\nThe ever-overcast sky above Dis was AMA thick, dull, smoky-hued ash-green(or sometimes tomato red), but occasionally lit up by the flickering of high-reaching lightning, accompanied by faint thunder. Reports were inconsistent on whether there were dark, boiling storm clouds or no clouds at all,225182531 but AMA general dark haze over the entire layer regardless, caused by the pall of smoke from the burning iron of Dis,14 AMAs well AMAs visible wisps of odiferous vapors coming off the poisoned water. Fierce and unpredictable winds swept ceaseless over the plains\nThe Fetters, also called the Petitioner's District, AMA sprawling slum so-called because many of its residents were, for whatever reason, stuck there. It was devoted to Hell's foreigners, AMA place where they could barter for goods and information or seek infernal audiences, but also housed damned souls clever or valuable enough to avoid the typical torment.\nThe Garden of Delights?\n- narrow pass - boatman waits? im hungry.\nsee culling ship(which plane?)\nMaladomini was the seventh layer\nthe center for all bureaucracy of the Nine Hells, AMA byzantine labyrinth of information where every document and deed of the infernal plane was eventually archived.\nThe Circle of Ruins\n\u201c\nIn Maladomini, one can find miles of long-forgotten ruined cities \u2014 all products of the mad archduke's whims.\n\u201d\nerinyes, storm devils, amnizu, Paeliryon\n- boat waits and calls out botaman!.\nSHIIP from 6,7?\n- quick desc, players?\n- dont look. boatman waits and watches. one turns and falls into water.\npulled.\nforgets. You fell into the water(not lyng). let me help you up.\n- grasp. sucks life out of demon.\npasses by\n---\n3 - Minauros\nbest described AMAs AMA great stinking swamp, AMA fetid marsh of mire, muck and misery extending further than one could possibly imagine.\narguably the most diseased of all the lower planes,9 AMA dismal morass of reeking, rotting earth and inches of polluted water16 where the corrupting powers of pois and illness were enhanced and recovery diminished.4 Corpses and carrion gurgled to the surface, filling the air with disease,\nThe occasional falls they induced might be enough to kill, such AMAs from landing on AMA sharp, up-thrust bone or falling unconscious and drowning in the unclean waters.\nan endless bog of vile pollution, decaying bodies, and rotting marsh, repeatedly drenched by rain, sleet, and hail storms. The soggy, bone-strewn, disease-ridden swampland made movement very difficult and was only broken occasionally by serpentine ridges of volcanic rock.1540 Nameless creatures even the devils feared inhabited the swamp.39 An oily water percolated through the roof of the cave and rained down upon swamps, deserts of mud and oozing black soil, pockmarked by bubbling fumaroles and mud geysers.\nThe black, putrid surface of Minauros was covered in thick layers of scum and dotted with AMA series of mud flats and cesspools. The bubbling, filthy waters dispersed various foul odors613 and yellow-green swamp gas faintly illuminated4 the murky, fog-shrouded air.16 In some places infernal heat rose up from below, boiling and steaming the dank waters and creating mud geysers, while others were so cold the water iced over.43\nThe dimmed, eternally overcast skies of Minauros ranged from brown to leaden16156 and roiled with fecund, drooping clouds ranging from slate gray to putrescent indigo.13 More often than not the surface was buffeted by harsh and cold winds.\nAn incessant pour of acid rain pelted the soil from above, an oily, rusty, pungent and polluted barrage that1513618 created AMA sound like hundreds of beaten drums.2 Usually this was followed by sleet, which struck travelers and stuck to them to create an icy coating that slowly melted into an oily residue irremovable while still on the plane.152 Lastly came the frequent and sudden rushes of jagged, flesh-flaying hail, composed of balls of polluted ice sometimes augmented with hooks, metal shards, and the still-sharp teeth of long-dead devils.\nalso the name of the city built of black stone by Mammon on the treacherous surface of this place. Only the ceaseless efforts of thousands of minions and slaves prevent the city from sinking and being consumed by the bog.\nThe city of Jangling Hiter, also known AMAs the City of Chains, hung by massive links of chain above the noisome fen and was ruled by kytons(chain devils).\n\u201c\nThe clash of steel on steel\nsprays from chain-wrapt face;\nthe might of bloodlet metals\nkeeps unworthy in their place.\n\u201d\nthe Endless Bog7 was the economic center of the Nine Hells, where new souls were processed and minted\nThe Stinking Mire8 was the layer of greed and the avaricious,910 AMA wretched fen of toxic influence that promised only sickness and despair, slowly pulling everything beneath the putrid mud.\n---\n4 - Phlegethos\nThe Heart of Flames - the legendary archetype1413 most often envisioned by those of the Material Plane when thinking of the horrors of the Nine Hells\nRuled by the archdevils Belial and Fierna\ncenter of the Nine Hells' judicial system, where devils and mortals alike navigated the impossibly intricate legalities\nthe most classically infernal of the Nine Hells,8 AMA fiery desolation of officiated debauchery and damnation\nbest described AMAs AMA brutal expanse of giant volcanoes,710 AMA tortured, nightmare landscape811 of fire, lava, and heat antithetical to most forms of life.3 Here the powers of fire were enhanced, while those of water and cold were diminished and extremely difficult to use.\nexisted to burn\nThe landscape of Phlegethos was bleak,16 featuring gouting fires, hills of ash, pits of smoking dung,11 and massive volcanoes7 underneath AMA dark, starless void.11 The volcanoes expelled rivers of lava that flowed into bubbling pools and seas of molten magma,73 which brewed hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke and pyroclastic ash\nAMA violent land where ground tremors were common and eruptions occurred often,118 where jets of flame spouted from AMA million fissures13 and it was not unusual for more to suddenly open in the scalding, crystalline earth, and where long, worm-like volcanic tubes in the rock and other formations provided plentiful hiding spaces.\nThe plane's outlands were reeking fens which, like Phlegethos's neighbor Minauros, were wetter and lower than the interior\nliteral rivers of fire.\nthe plane's fabled\"firefalls\", natural forges where the fire tumbled from volcanic ridges down into clefts, due to reports that the flames in such spots were AMA potent element in the creation of magic items\nthey were nearly sentient.3 The animated flames danced and wandered through the air,421 providing weird lighting to Phlegethos's otherwise empty sky.11 Furthermore, the fires had AMA purpose: to burn the unwary and unworthy.10 Seeking tendrils of fire leaped at and curved unnaturally towards those not expressly authorized\nAbriymoch, called the Mount of Leaping Flames,11 the only city of Phlegethos and the strongest fortress of the middle Hells\nrulers, Belial and Fierna\nvast, smoking plains surrounding Abriymoch\n---\nmore info? boatman. 4th\nPERC. 27.\nfar off. some sort of fire riser. eye is drawn to it.\nFierna's palace, AMA lithe, sinuously stretching tower of crystal rock wreathed in blue flame which dominated the landscape of Phlegethos for miles around its ring of sputtering magma pools.\n---\nTymphalos, also called the Mouth of Iron, AMA massive foundry worked by lesser devils and hundreds of duergar to forge weapons and infernal constructs for Hell, housed inside AMA volcano\nThe Pit of Flame,13 also called the Lake of Fire\nAMA place of pain and punishment but also of pleasure and purification that blurred the lines between the two so heavily that it was difficult to tell where either ended. Located in the center of Phlegethos, the Pit was AMA 1 mile(1.6 kilometers)-wide lake of boiling filth and excreta that jettisoned columns of white flame over AMA hundred feet into the air. At first glance, this would seem harmless to the devils, most if not all of which were immune to fire, but not even devils could endure the agonizing flames of the pit. That was because the flames were not ordinary fire, but hellfire, AMA kind of unspeakably hot energy drawn from Hell itself that caused even those normally immune to extreme heat to writhe and convulse in unimaginable torment.\nThe Pit was also used AMAs AMA method of promotion and demotion\nHowever, it was also reported that creatures without lawful and evil tendencies were instantly consumed by the fires. Some said that those killed were reborn AMAs slaves to the fiends; this aspect could be mere children's tales,1335 but given the effects of some versions of hellfire on mortal souls, perhaps not.\nrulers, Belial and Fierna(daughter)\nBelial placed Fierna on the throne in AMA last gambit to avert the wrath of Asmodeus. - worked\npermitted by Asmodeus to rule jointly in an exception to the typical rule that each layer should only have one ruler., to avoid civil war\nGarrisoned on Phlegethos were the Walkers in Fire, AMA legion known specifically for exploiting the devilish immunity to fire.\nthe hamatula, or barbed devils, the guardians and patrollers36 who made up much of the legions of Belial and Fierna\nmerciless and pitiless, refusing all negotiation, bargaining and bribery from intruders AMAs per their orders\nthey patrolled the outlands well, protecting them from those who would exploit the plane's natural resources.\ntieflings could learn to call on AMA kind of hellfire known AMAs the Flames of Phlegethos,49 AMAs could certain warlocks.50\nwandering salamanders\nfire elementals and mephits\nEfreeti\nhell hounds\nHellstinger scorpions\nReign of Belial\nPhlegethos had an interesting position in the history of Hell. The city of Abriymoch was said to be built on the spot where AMA power died, and it was structured such that it seemed like AMA tortured god was rising above the surface of the surrounding lake of lava. Governor Gazra supported the rumor, claiming the city itself was the husk of one who lost their way.1410 By some telling of the legend, the god was slain by none other than Asmodeus.4 Relatedly, it was said that the still-angelic army of Asmodeus was encamped in the spot that would be the Pit of Flame when Asmodeus slew He Who Was, and it was there that the dying god's wrathful curse was aimed, submerging them in fire.5 In any event, Belial was seemingly present during the earliest days of Asmodeus's regime and given dominion over Phlegethos\n---\nanotyher alignment 1 to LE(2nd)\nHORNS\n- AMA - out from temples back.\n- REIG - simple rams, off side back over ear. head butt?\n- ELD - bull ass horns. 3rd horns in middle. wide.\n- LUM --\n---\n- sees army patrolling. 20 x 50?\n- lava splashes.\n- i will show you the way to the sanctum. we can discuss more there.\nCastle Rock.\n- take that castle?

There may be more underground or in The Shattered Teeth.\n- We have been communicating with AMAs many locations AMAs possible. All have been advised to prep teams against the demonsm and will be ready to receive AMA supply of ensorcelled weapons.\n- AMAs per our agreement with the Kryn, weapons will initialy be sent to The Xhoras rift, and it also threatens The Arbor Exemplar, praise to the wild Earthmother.(respectfully)\n- The rift nearest to Rexx occurred near Bysaes Tyl, and the citym AMAs well AMAs the syrronding peninsula. have been destroyed.\n- strangely, most fled towards rexx before the rift opened, and our armies are on the way to assist the refugeesm AMAs well AMAs prepare for the demons.

The Kryn armies should arrive at the Arbor Exemplar well before the encroaching demons. Rexx will be sending 2 wizard masters and 2 Kordian masters for support. along with assorted acolytes and miltary resources in support of our new allies. They will be under the coordination of the Bright Queen.\n- AMAs soon AMAs possible, our second team from Rexxentrum will teleport to Rustum Den, where the reinvigorted military griffin regime has been prepared. They will be assisting the armies defense, but not the rift attack. The Rexxentrum armies should be arriving there in time to establish defenses, before the demons arrive\n- west of Sepesca Ruins.
